Player 1:
arrows - walk
A - attack
S - magic
Z - talk/examine
hold X - use stamina (runs, attacks faster)
1, 2, 3, 4 - select magic
Esc - quit the game
Tab - Change between multiplayer/single player

Player 2:
I, J, K, L - walk
D - attack
F - magic
C - talk/examine
hold V - use stamina (runs, attacks faster)
5, 6, 7, 8 - select magic

The keys used by player 2 are not very good, but that's because we made the game in a notebook without numeric keyboard. You can use a joystick with Xpadder to make things easier.
